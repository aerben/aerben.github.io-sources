GitHub is full of wonders. I just started to play around with some Hexo themes and plugins for my new blog. Then when I pushed some changes to the GitHub Pages repo, I receive an ominous mail.

Usually, the mails that I receive on GitHub contain notifications about Pull Requests or Issues that I follow. But this time, things are different.

Well, as it turns out, a plugin I wanted to use has a dependency to an outdated library. Nice of GitHub to tell me. I would never have guessed that GitHub scans all source code in GitHub Pages-repositories for possible vulnerabilities. I guess it's more or less in their own interest as well as in mine.
