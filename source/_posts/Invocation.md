There is much to like about autumnal Germany - the changing colors of the leaves, the cold and windy breeze, that special kind of atmosphere you only get when the year is soon coming to an end - you know the clichés as much as I do.
However, Mid-November Germany is also infamous for its unsteady weather, and the weather forces me to stay inside in rainy Regensburg while I could be outside celebrating the fact that this town has largely been unscarred by the bombs of the Second World War - only to be invaded by an army of tourists growing each year. The one good thing about rain is that it is an effective repellent for tourists. Then again, they wouldn't bother me anyway drinking my Americano in a run-down café...

To make the best out of the situation, I finally decided to jot down some of the things I've learned about software development over the past years. I'm quite sure that this weblog will start off with an inital batch of articles until I lose interest, only to be guiltily revisited each year and be left with another post promising I'll soon get to write more. And then there will be that one entry which becomes modestly popular even though it is about the most basic topic.

Until then, let's launch this project with a topic wholesome enough for a series of at least three posts: HashiCorp Consul.
